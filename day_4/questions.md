## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
  - A method allows us to perform certain actions within our script when we call it to action. A method allows us to better manipulate our script and create specific scenarios.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
  - def hello
      p "Sam I am"
    end

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
  - def hello_someone(name)
      p "#{name} I am"
    end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
  - hello_someone("Kenz")
