## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
  - A conditional statement tells us if something is true or false depending on the given conditionals.
  - Examples:
    5 == 5 # => true
    "Larry" == "Larry" && 7 > 12 # => false
    4 + 4 >= 8

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
  - You might want to use an if statement if you are trying to manipulate the outcome or direction of a program.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
  - A "code block" for a Ruby if statement looks like this:
      if 5 > 3
        puts "Math is fun!"
      end

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
  - You can add multiple confitions to an if statement by following if with elsif and/or else.

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
  - if hair_color == blonde
      puts "You should use purple shampoo."
    elsif hair_color == brown
      puts "Brown hair is so easy to maintain!"
    elsif hair_color == red
      puts "Red heads have the most fun!"
    else
      puts "Whatever hair style or color you choose, I am sure you look amazing!"
    end

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
