## Day 5 Questions

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
  - A hash is like an information table matching keys with their values. An array is just a collection of data not matched to anything.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
  - pet_store = {
    "Goldfish": 785,
    "Kittens": 13,
    "Lizards": 9
  }

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
  - states["Iowa"]

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
  - states.keys
  - states.values

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
  - A classroom full of students and the names of their parents. A hash would be best for the because we could match the student name to the parent name. You can not match key value pairs with arrays. 

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
