## Day 2 Questions

1. Create an array containing the following strings: `"zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"`.
  - array = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]

1. Save the array you created above to a variable `animals`.
  - animals = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]

1. Using the array `animals`, how would you access `"giraffe"`?
  - p animals[1]

1. How would you add `"lion"` to the `animals` array?
  - animals.push("lion")

1. Name and describe two additional array methods:
  - .include? method
      - This method will ask the program if a specific declared variable value is included in the associated array. The output will be a boolean.
  - .pop method
      - This method will remove the last element of an array and return the removed elements.

1. What are the boolean values in Ruby?
